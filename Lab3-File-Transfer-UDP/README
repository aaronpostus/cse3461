Course: CSE 3461

Instructions:

First place any test images/files in the client_files directory in my lab folder.

Then establish three SSH connections.
Two should be on one system, and the other should be a different one.
Example:
ssh post.194@cse-sl1.coeit.osu.edu    # 1 - Client
ssh post.194@cse-sl1.coeit.osu.edu    # 2 - Troll
ssh post.194@cse-sl2.coeit.osu.edu    # 3 - Server

First run this command on ssh connection #1 and #3 to find the ip addresses
hostname -I
Note these ip addresses.

Now navigate to my lab folder on all systems.

Run this command on ssh connection #3 (server)
python3 ftps.py <server-port>
*note, you pick the server port. it can be anything, just be consistent.*

Run this command on ssh connection #2 (troll)
troll -C <client-ip-address> -S <server-ip-address> -a 31295 -b <server-port> -r -s 1 -t -x 0 <troll-port>
*Use ip addresses from before. The server port should be the same as the step before. 
The troll port can be anything, but be consistent. If the client port 31295 is busy you may
have to make a change to ftpc.py (change the localport field at top of file).*

Run this command on ssh connection #3 (client)
python3 ftpc.py <client-ip-address> <server-port> <troll-port> <file>
*Use client ip address and the server port from before. 
Troll port should be the same as the previous step as well.
Note: Your file name should be the name of a file within the server_files directory. No path necessary.
You should append any necessary extensions as well for the file type, ie. "1.jpg" *

The file transfer protocol should automatically begin and you should see activity in troll. A message will
appear in the server that indicates the file has finished writing to the disk. You can then check that it is
identical to the original file using diff.


Sample (tested) commands:
# call this on your system 2 connection
python3 ftps.py 24718
# call this on one of your system 1 connections   
troll -C 10.128.100.10 -S 10.128.100.11 -a 31295 -b 24718 -r -s 1 -t -x 0 42718
# call this on the other system 1 connection  
python3 ftpc.py 10.128.100.11 24718 42718 1.jpg 

Notes:
I've found STDLinux to be a bit finnicky about the files appearing but my code absolutely
works as intended. You just may need to go back and forth from the server_files directory
to get the file to appear.
