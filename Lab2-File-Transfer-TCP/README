Instructions:

SSH to two different machines on stdlinux, i.e.
ssh post.194@cse-sl1.coeit.osu.edu
ssh post.194@cse-sl2.coeit.osu.edu

Now place your images/test data in the client_files directory in my lab folder.

Now go to the main directory for my lab where you can see the python files.

Then choose one machine to run the server program, ftps.py and run this command:
python3 ftps.py <port>

This will print out the server IP address which you will use for the client.

Then run the client program, ftpc.py on the other machine
python3 ftpc.py <server ip address> <port> <filename>

Note: Your file name should be the name of a file within the client_files directory.
You should append any necessary extensions as well for the file type, ie. "1.jpg"

Sample server and client commands:
python3 ftps.py 41289
python3 ftpc.py 10.128.100.11 41289 1.jpg

Notes:
I've found STDLinux to be a bit finnicky about the files appearing but my code absolutely
works as intended. You just may need to go back and forth from the server_files directory
to get the file to appear.
