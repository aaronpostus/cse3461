Instructions:

Run "python3 copy.py <name of image, including file extension>"
E.g. "python3 copy.py 1.jpg"

Notes:

The recv directory does not need to exist. The copy.py program will create it if it doesn't exist.
You must provide exactly one argument of a file that exists in the local directory. If you provide
more or less than one argument or provide an invalid file name/path, a message will print and the 
program will terminate.
